        <section id="about-me" class="about-me">
          <h6>Currently enrolled in a 6 month Full Stack Development Bootcamp known as Monash Coding Bootcamp (powered to Trilogy Education Services).</h6>
          <p>
            As an established user of NetSuite and a concise aim of becoming a JavaScript Developer, I made the decision to utilize my customer service and finance experience to move into an ERP Support role for NetSuite, which aligns with my career vision.
            With a responsibility of undertaking requirements and translating them into action, I’ve recently developed and deployed my first script into production. I took great pride in delivering this as this was an enhancement (when I was a user) that I knew would make a difference to my day to day duties.
            My core responsibility is to be accountable for the maintenance, continuity, and support of this principal financial ERP system. I aim to grow my knowledge and continue to develop and deploy scripts to solve business needs, with the career view of transitioning into a developer role.
